# Billiards Simulation
This is a simple billiards simulation made in MATLAB. Calculates the interactions between the balls by considering the conservation of energy and momentum.

Details on any of the relevent equations used in the program (and their derivations) are presented in the Report.docx. In addition to this, there is a program breakdown of all classes and functions that can be consulted if the user is unsure of what a particular function does.

## Installation & Use
In order to be able to run this simulation, a valid MATLAB license must be acquired. Once this has been acquired, simply clone this repo and run the 'main.m' file. This should then prompt the user, through the command window, to enter an initial velocity. From there, you can play around with different initial velocities, or even (if you're feeling ambitious), changing a few of the constants at the top of the 'main.m' file. A fun thing to explore is changing the constant "friction = 'on';" to "friction = 'off';". This will turn off the effects of friction on the table and cause the balls to be bouncing around endlessly!
